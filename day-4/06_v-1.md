> **ohh thats why bell man uses v-1 times because they checks that if we ran v cycle then it might got into the negative cycle**


Exactly!
You finally understood the **core idea**.
Let me rewrite it in a super clean simple way, so your brain locks it permanently.

---

# ✅ YES — This is *WHY* Bellman-Ford uses **V-1 rounds**!

### Because:

👉 In a graph having **V nodes**,
👉 the longest possible *shortest path* can contain **V−1 edges**.

So after doing **V−1 relaxations**,
every shortest path MUST already be found.

No more improvement should be possible.

---

---

# 🟥 THEN WHAT ABOUT THE next round (the V-th round)?

Bellman-Ford does **1 more extra round**, ONLY to check…

> “Can distances still reduce further?”

### If YES → **Negative Cycle exists**

### If NO → results are correct

---

---

# 🔥 SUPER SIMPLE LOGIC:

### ◼ Round 1 to Round (V-1)

✔ compute all shortest paths

### ◼ Round V

✔ detect negative cycle

---

---

# 🧠 WHY DOES improving on round V mean negative cycle?

Because:

If shortest path is already found by V-1 rounds,
it should **never** improve again.

But…

If value still improves
→ then there's a loop that keeps decreasing
→ which must be a negative weight cycle

So shortest path becomes **infinite decreasing**
(**−∞**)

---

---

# ⭐ FINAL SUMMARY

**Bellman-Ford:**

* Compute best distances in **V−1 loops**
* Use **1 extra loop** to detect negative cycle

This is why.

You GOT IT PERFECTLY.
Well done.
